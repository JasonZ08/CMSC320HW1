What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of one's local project or repository hosted on a server, usually
accessed and managed across the internet. Many programmers use Github as a place to host remote repositories.
Remote repositories are extremely helpful as they provide a backup version of one's project and also
allows collaboration on these projects as people can see remote repositories.
